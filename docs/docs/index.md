# Chrono

Chrono is a logging, telemetry, and replay framework designed for FTC that enables *log replay*.
Chrono can write data to log files, and live telemetry streams both using the
[RLOG format](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/blob/main/RLOG-SPEC.md)
compatible with [AdvantageScope](https://docs.advantagescope.org).

It is inspired by [AdvantageKit](https://docs.advantagekit.org), and written from the ground up in Kotlin.

:::tip
For a deeper understanding, and more information about **log replay** or **deterministic logging**,
refer to FRC 6328's documentation on AdvantageKit [here](https://docs.advantagekit.org).
